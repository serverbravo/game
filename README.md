# Game

All about that game, a publicly made-available manifesto.

## Introduction

> So many companies to buy products from, so much dating coaches & instructors to learn from, so much concepts of game and life to learn from - yet, all of them operate on the same grey areas: The Macro Concepts, or the things that operate on the bird's eye view.

> This one-page index aims for one fucking thing: **to make the world a better place by giving the next damned guy who'll stumble on this page the right things, the right tools, and the right mindsets _in getting more out of life - period_.**

## What Is Game?

#### A Definition

> Simply put, 'having game' or 'knowing how to game' is stereotypically depicted as being able to dive into a great interaction with a good looking girl of your standards, and rightafter magically end up sleeping with each other - carrying too the possible outcome of having a great, fun & meaningful relationship with each other in the long run.

> **However, we would like to define 'having game' as being an invariably effective guy who handles his health, wealth, relationships & happiness with grit & efficiency.** This means a guy who got game for us is someone who doesn't miss out on the good things in life, for the most part of his lifetime at least.

# Game

All about that game, a publicly made-available manifesto.

## Introduction

> So many companies to buy products from, so much dating coaches & instructors to learn from, so much concepts of game and life to learn from - yet, all of them operate on the same grey areas: The Macro Concepts, or the things that operate on the bird's eye view.

> This one-page index aims for one fucking thing: **to make the world a better place by giving you - and the next damned guy who'll stumble on this page - _the right things, the right tools, and the right mindsets in getting more out of life - period_.**

## What Is Game?

#### A Definition

> Simply put, 'having game' or 'knowing how to game' is stereotypically depicted as being able to dive into a great interaction with a good looking girl of your standards, and rightafter magically end up sleeping with each other - carrying too the possible outcome of having a great, fun & meaningful relationship with each other in the long run.

> **However, we would like to define 'having game' as being an invariably effective guy who handles his health, wealth, relationships & happiness with grit & efficiency.** This means a guy who got game for us is someone who doesn't miss out on the good things in life - although realistically: for the most part of his lifetime at least.

#### A Perspective

> Having game for us means viewing things in the right perspective, being able to see things as they are - as realistically as possible - and be able to extract the right next move.. a thing of which drives us to our next point:

#### An Edge

> Yes, having game for is **means having an edge as a man**. Being able to handle your own health, your personal finance, your business & career, hell even your relationships - ask any guy out there who got at least one of these areas handled and we'll bet our balls that at this point already it's already a no-brainer for you to realize just how much your life could be gazillion times better if you got an edge on these areas already.

#### An Approach To Life

> Finally, yes - and this final point is actually a home-run.

> We having game means living most of your days being proactive instead of passive, of being a man who makes decisions and takes the right actions instead of reacting and just settling with mediocrity, of being convicted by the fact that right here, right now is your fucking lifetime ticking by the minute - and that the only thing that matters now is getting more out of this fleeting thing you call 'life', and (hopefully) being able to give back too towards the other generations including your love ones.

> That's game in a nutshell for us. How about you, WHAT IS GAME FOR YOU?
